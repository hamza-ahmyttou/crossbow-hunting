# Crossbow Hunting

**Crossbow Hunting** is a 3D hunting video game developed in Java. Players explore a virtual wilderness, and use a crossbow to hunt with stealth and precision.

Originally hosted on GitLab, the project has been fully transitioned to GitHub, complete with modern CI using GitHub Actions and Gradle-based builds.
